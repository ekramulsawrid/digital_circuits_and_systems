## Installation and Implementation

The instructions are for running the code on Xilinx ISE Design Suite (WebPACK edition) 14.7.

### Installation  

1) In your console or terminal, go to the directory you want to clone this respository in. 
2) Type `https://github.com/ekramulsawrid/digital_circuits_and_systems.git` to clone to that directory.

### Implementation

1) Open folder the desired folder of this directory in Xilinx ISE Design Suite.
2) To see circuit design:
    1) Make sure that the .vdh file of the circuit is selected.
    2) Make sure are in implementation view.
    3) Drop down Synthesize - XST in Processes. Run View Technology Schematic.
